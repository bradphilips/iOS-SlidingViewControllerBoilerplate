iOS-SlidingViewControllerBoilerplate
====================================

Boilerplate sliding view controller template based on Mike Enriquez's awesome [ECSlidingViewController](https://github.com/edgecase/ECSlidingViewController) and Matt Gallagher's beautiful [re-usable tableview article](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2010/12/uitableview-construction-drawing-and.html).

This also builds upon some 'best practices' I have used in the past to create modular and re-usable mobile apps for such as servicing layers, model mapping, and view-logic separation.
